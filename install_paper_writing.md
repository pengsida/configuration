# How to write a good paper

Paper writing is a process that finetunes a shit to a delicious dinner. Don't fear to write down.

1. Write down a clear thought flow. A clear thought flow is the most important thing in paper writing.
2. Finetune each section.

## What do we care in a paper

1. Learn some interesting things about the idea in the paper.
2. A paper should be about a single focused idea or question.
3. All claims should be supported by experiment or by citation.

### The concrete things we need to write in the paper

1. Discuss all the relevant papers.
2. Discuss all important details: algorithm, evaluation protocol, benchmark, benchmark metric, training procedure, baselines.
3. Ensure that the work can be reproduced from the information in the paper.
4. Validate the claims of the paper.
5. Fair comparisons.
6. Discuss the limitations of the work.

## Outline of any section or any paragraph

1. Think about a core idea you want to express.
2. Think about characters related to the core idea.
3. Set up a flow among characters: one inducts another one.

## Sentence writing

1. Flow between two sentences.
2. Read more papers and consult similar writing.

For sentences in introduction

1. Focus on the motivation and the benefit from our proposed approach.

For sentences in method

1. The approach detail is the major content. Besides, we should talk about the motivation and the benefit at a proper place.

## Introduction writing

The most important thing: motivation!

1. Why is this problem important.
2. Why are previous methods not good enough.
3. Why is our method better than previous methods.

To fully illustrate our motivation, we generally organize the introduction as follows

1. Problem statement.
2. Introduce the challenge through talking about the limitations of previous works.
3. Motivation of our approach.
4. Motivation of our actions.

Talk as many as motivation as possible: one sentence for one action and several sentences for motivation of this action.

## Related work writing

What we can talk about when writing related work

1. Summarize a class of methods with one or two sentences.
2. Further summarize the subclasses of methods by time.
3. Say advantages of such methods compared with previous methods.
4. Briefly introduce several representative methods. These methods should be at a flow that next method resolves last method's limitation. When introducing a method, we first talk about its good by saying how it resolves previous methods' limitation, and then talk about its limitation.
5. Talk about our method's advantage over these methods.

## Method writing

1. Overview of the proposed approach. It is a must before describing our approach in detail.
2. It is better to describe the content of a section before detailed description.
