## Introduction

What is the meaning of relational reasoning to we humans

1. Humans' capacity for combinatorial generalization depends critically on our cognitive mechanisms for representing structure and reasoning about relations.
2. Represent complex systems as compositions of entities and their interactions.
3. Use hierarchies to abstract away from fine-grained differences.
4. Solve novel problems by composing familiar skills and routines.
5. Draw analogies by aligning the relational structure between two domains.
6. Draw inferences about one based on corresponding knowledge about the other.

What is relational reasoning

1. Structure: the product of composing a set of known building blocks.
2. Structured representation: capture the object composition.
3. Structured computations: operate over the elements and their composition as a whole.
4. Relational reasoning: manipulate structured representations of entities and relations, using rules for how they can be composed.

Entity, relation and rule

1. Entity: an element with attributes, such as a physical object with a size and mass.
2. Relation: relationship between entities. Relations can have attributes and can be sensitive to the global context.
3. Rule: a function that maps entities and relations to other entities and relations.

What is inductive bias

1. An inductive bias allows a learning algorithm to prioritize one of solutions to interpret the world.
2. Inductive bias in Bayesian model: a prior distribution.
3. Inductive bias help find solutions which generalize in a desirable way.
4. We leverage inductive biases to express assumptions that how a model or algorithm interfaces with the world.
